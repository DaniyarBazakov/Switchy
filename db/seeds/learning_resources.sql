    (6, 'Online Course', 'Node.js for Backend Development', 'https://www.example.com/nodejs-backend', 
    'Node.js is a powerful and flexible JavaScript runtime that is used for server-side programming. Built on Chromes V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server, which opens up new possibilities for web development. Unlike traditional server-side technologies, Node.js operates on a non-blocking, event-driven model, which makes it highly efficient and capable of handling numerous simultaneous connections with minimal resource consumption. This is particularly advantageous for building real-time applications, like chat applications, online games, or collaborative platforms. Node.js also has a large ecosystem of libraries and modules, available through npm (Node Package Manager), making it easier to add functionality and integrate with other tools. In this course, you will learn how to use Node.js to build scalable backend systems. Topics will include setting up a server, handling HTTP requests, connecting to databases, implementing authentication and security, and deploying applications to cloud platforms. By the end of the course, you will have the skills to build a fully functioning backend for web applications using Node.js and understand its role in the broader software development process.',
